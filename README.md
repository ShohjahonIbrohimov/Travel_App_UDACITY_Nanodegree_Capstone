# Travel_App_UDACITY_Nanodegree_Capstone
Building an app which will help travellers organize their trip easily
In this project I used CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION?
1. press the button which says +add trip
2. you will see a form with two required input feilds. Fill in them and then press submit
3. The application automatically dispplay the image of the location and the date of department as well as current weather
if your trip is within a weeek or 16 day weather forecast if in the future.
4. You can also see that there are 3 card like boxes with names: 1. Lodging info 2. Packing List. 3. Notes.
You can edit and save as many times as you want.
5. To create another trip return to input fields and enter necessary details about the trip.
